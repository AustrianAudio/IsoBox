DIY 40db A-weighted Isobox for under 150â‚¬
Feel free to use this design in order to make your own Isobox for measuring acoustic equipment such as microphones. Be sure to read the very liberal license agreement. 
No support provided. 
Our engineers are very busy but want to share as much as possible with the audio community and we will release as many things into the wild as Open Source as is reasonably allowable.
